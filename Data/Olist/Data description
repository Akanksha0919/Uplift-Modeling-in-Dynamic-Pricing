The study employs the dataset from Kaggle. This dataset is from an e-commerce firm called Olist which is one of the largest online marketplaces in Brazil and contains the information of 10000 orders placed by consumers on
the online platform of the company between the year 2016 to 2018 (Olist & Sionek, n.d.). Olist gives an online platform to different businesses and sellers across Brazil to connect with consumers and sell their products. 
When an order is placed for a particular product on Olist by a customer, the seller is notified of the order placement to be fulfilled (Olist & Sionek, n.d.). An order can contain multiple products of different quantities.
